Write an app that asks the user to input his name in an text input, and
immediately - as they type - says Hello back to them and reports the number of characters in his name. Hints at the bottom of this file. For example, "Hello, Elaine! There are 6 letters in your name."

      What is your name?<br>
      <input type="text" ng-model="name"><br>
      <label>Hello, {{name}}! Your name is {{name.length}} letters long. Hooray!</label>

<!--
Hints: look at angular-examples/1-hello-world.html for the structure. You can use the `.length` property to get the number
of characters in a string. It even works in an AngularJS expression: `{{name.length}}`.
